The Angular Auth Workflow package provides a consistent [authentication and registration experience](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/patterns/user-auth) across Eaton web applications using Angular. 

This includes pre-built implementations of the screens for Login, Forgot Password, Self-Registration, Contact Support, Registration By Invitation, and a dialog for Change Password.

This documentation explains the steps required to integrate this auth workflow into your application.
